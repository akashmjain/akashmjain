### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a software engineer mainly working in the payments domain at Ezetap. While working here I
acquired a lot of useful experiences and tools to hone my software engineering skills. Even though my
working experience is with Java related technologies, I am passionate about learning new stuff
revolving around the software domain and am always trying my best to learn new things.
